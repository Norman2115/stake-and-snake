## The Graph
Our game is fully powered by The Graph, from lobby games and tournament matches to the leaderboard. We store data on-chain for player transparency and use The Graph's subgraph to fetch and organize it efficiently. This eliminates the need to use getters in smart contracts, which are unstructured and inefficient.
- [Here](packages/snake-subgraph-scroll/) is the repository for the subgraph indexing the Scroll Sepolia network.
- [Here](packages/snake-graph-vanar/) is the repository for the subgraph indexing the Vanguard network.
