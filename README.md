# Stake & Snake

## Description
"My brain is stuck!"

"I want to make something fun"

"2025 is a snake year!"

Oh, the Nokia 3310 OG Snake game? Yep, thatâ€™s how we got here. We aim to solve the problem where many Web3 games are overly focused on blockchain incentives and have complex UIs. As a newcomer myself, it can be quite difficult for us who are just trying to explore around. Our focus is on making the experience simple, fun, and user-friendly at a glance.

Stake & Snake is a Web3 snake game that merges the nostalgia of the classic Snake with blockchain staking. Snake game, but at Web 3, with staking. Players can stake and compete, with first place taking all in public/private lobbies, while tournaments reward the top 10 ranked players on the podium, with higher ranks earning a bigger cut. A 5%â€“10% fee is taken from the prize pools to keep the platform running and cover gas fees for automated operations.

The game is a prototype. If you spot any mathematical miscalculations... Just pretend itâ€™s abstract art and move on.

## Vanar (Vanguard)
Gaming is one of the Big 5 use cases of Vanar Chain. The fast transactions and fixed low fees aspects of Vanar make it ideal for a gaming platform where players can enjoy without worrying about high gas fees.

## The Graph
Our game is fully powered by The Graph, from lobby games and tournament matches to the leaderboard. We store data on-chain for player transparency and use The Graph's subgraph to fetch and organize it efficiently.
* [Here](packages/snake-subgraph-scroll/) is the repository for the subgraph indexing the **Scroll Sepolia** network.
* [Here](packages/snake-graph-vanar/) is the repository for the subgraph indexing the **Vanguard** network.
* TheGraph Endpoint: https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/104999/snake-subgraph-scroll/version/latest
* For the frontend subgraph integration, we use **Apollo Client** to fetch data from the subgraph. [Here](packages/nextjs/app/lobbies/page.tsx#L16-L77) is an example.

We decided to make it cross-chain, with a single subgraph querying each chain. Unfortunately, we couldn't provide the endpoint for the Vanguard subgraph as it is running on our **local Graph Node**. However, here are some screenshots.
